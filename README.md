# AutonomousCar
Simulation of and autonomous car traversing through a 2D Map in MATLAB.

The simulator recieves a starting and finishing point for the car, computes the best path between both points and travels through the path, respecting the traffic signs. It's possible to add stop traffic signs, speed limit traffic signs, pedestrians crossing at pre-defined times and pedestrian traffic signs on the 2D map.
